## The Project

This project has a goal to develop a recurrent neural netwokrk capable to make a sentimental analysis based on IMDB dataset, using users comments about the movies they whatched. The neural network must do predictions and evaluate if a particular comment was positive of negative, using a 0 to 1 scale, where the values that approach to 0 indicates a bad evaluation and values that approach to 1 indicates a good one. 

You can take a look at our wiki project to know more about it [here](https://lucianaribeiro.github.io/filmood/#/).
